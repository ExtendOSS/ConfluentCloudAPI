# Confluent API

## Setup

* `pnpm install`
* Optional: Install and setup the [github cli](https://cli.github.com/) if you want to take advantage of the optional `pnpm pr` command.

## What is this?

Well quite simply it is a typescript API for confluent cloud. Is it the best one, nope. Is it the only one, yep. So either rewrite it, use it, or do both and help configure it.

## How do I use it?

Mostly this is used to help build out infrastructural tooling. For example, you can use this to create a kafka cluster, create topics, and then create service accounts for those topics. You can also use this to create a service account and then create a kafka cluster and topics for that service account. As well as building out a schema registry and connect cluster.

## How do I contribute?

* Create a branch
* Make your changes
* Then we will review it and merge it

## Todo

Kinda everything. But mostly build a great readme before open sourcing it(whoops too late).
